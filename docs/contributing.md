## Coding Guidelines

### JavaScript Style Guide

We follow the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) with some modifications. Key points:

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use semicolons
- Use single quotes for strings
- Use ES6 features (arrow functions, template literals, etc.)
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Documentation

- Document all public functions, classes, and modules
- Use JSDoc comments for API documentation
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes

### Testing

- Write tests for all new features and bug fixes
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request
- Aim for high test coverage

## Git Workflow

### Branches

- `main`: The main development branch
- `feature/*`: Feature branches
- `bugfix/*`: Bug fix branches
- `release/*`: Release branches

### Commit Messages

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for commit messages:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Types:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or fixing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

Examples:
```
feat(proxy): add support for WebSocket connections
fix(static): resolve issue with serving index.html
docs: update installation instructions
```

## Release Process

1. Update version number in `package.json`
2. Update CHANGELOG.md
3. Create a new release branch: `release/vX.Y.Z`
4. Create a pull request to merge the release branch into `main`
5. After the pull request is merged, create a new GitHub release
